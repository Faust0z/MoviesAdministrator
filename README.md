# Movies Admin with StreamLit

This app is meant to be a way to register movies, directors and actors and allow the user to query the data.

To create the app, you can either use the Dockerfile to create a container with the main app or the docker-compose to
create a container with the main app and another container with a MySQL database.

If you install locally, just use python 3.13 and run the app with: ``streamlit run .\run.py``
